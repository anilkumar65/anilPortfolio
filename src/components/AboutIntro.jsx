        Hi, I'm [Your Name].<br/>
I came to Japan in 2014 to study the Japanese language and later pursued an IT-focused degree in the Faculty of English Information Management. After graduating, I gained experience in hotel front-desk operations as well as translation and interpretation as a dispatch employee. I also hold a TOEIC score of 755.<br/><br/>

I am skilled in Java, React, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and I can communicate in four languages: Japanese, English, Nepali, and Hindi. Leveraging my multicultural background and strong communication skills, I thrive in diverse environments and aim to contribute value through both my technical abilities and adaptability.
